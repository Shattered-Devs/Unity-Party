This is the official Unity Party branch for the vs. Niko mod.
## How to Open Project
The vs. Niko mod is created using the Unity Party engine which uses the Unity Engine to run.
### Requirements
 - [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download)
	 - Required to download and run the required Unity Editor version.
	 - A comprehensive guide is [available here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStartedInstallingHub.html).
 - [Unity Editor 2020.3.20](unityhub://2020.3.20f1/41c4e627c95f)
	 - Newer versions can open the project, but future changes may be incompatible.
	 - The link supplied will open Unity Hub to install the specific version. Be sure that Unity Hub is **fully installed**.
 - An IDE/Code Editor
	 - You could use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) (requires [preparations](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/other/unity)) or [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/dow) ([can support Unity natively](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/unity-tools)).

[Clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository), then check out the "niko-v2" branch. It will take a while to download the files. Now, you can go into Unity Hub and "open" the project by selecting the repository folder.

**Don't know what is "cloning" or don't want to?** Alternatively, you can download the branch source as a .zip, then extract it somewhere. Use that folder location when opening a project within Unity Hub.
