I made like new notes, could you maybe add them in the game replacing the current ones?
That'll be cool ^^

For the event sprites for call song :
I added an mp3 for which part of the song a certain animation should be played 
(it's on the "mp3thing" folder, hope it helps!)


For the nitro & deleted folder :
BF's sprites will be used for both songs
But hecker's sprites will change depending on the song
